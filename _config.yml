As an ambitious and hard-working individual, I am often recognized for my commitment and ability by highly respected companies. 
I handle multiple tasks on a daily basis competently, working well under the pressure. Frequent acknowledgment of my contribution from senior management illustrates my potential value to your company.
A key strength is communication; building strong relationships with people in order to deliver the best results. 
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my suitability in more detail.Even though I take my work seriously, I do have a good sense of humour.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
